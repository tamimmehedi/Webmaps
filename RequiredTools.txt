Building a Webmap using Python is not that easy as Python doesn't have all the features.
One PL should also not have all the features. Otherwise, it would become a very heavy Language. 
To build a map, we mainly need the help of HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
And Python has a very cool feature to convert a Python code into a HTML,CSS or JavaScript Code. 
It's named Folium.
You can just install it from your cmd prompt. 
regarding the editor: my suggestion is to use Atom because it is very dynamic and fast. 
I will be uploading gradually the code to build a Webmap.  
Stay tuned and have fun with coding.
